The TODO Group Steering Committee has published our [2026 strategic goals](https://github.com/todogroup/governance/blob/main/goals.md), building on the themes from our [2025 end-of-year review](https://todogroup.org/blog/end-of-year-2025/). 
These goals reflect the community's input and the Steering Committee's commitment to supporting TODO Group practitioners, Ambassadors, and member organizations to strengthen the impact of open source management within organizations' objectives, engaging strategically with open source ecosystems.

This year, TODO Group's direction aims tofocus on three pillars: growing leadership capacity, helping OSPOs demonstrate value across AI and security, and maintaining the resources our community relies on.

### G1 -- Grow and Sustain Leadership Roles in the Community

Making it easier for people to step into and succeed in leadership positions is essential for the long-term health of any open source community. In 2026, we're creating clearer entry points and more consistent support for emerging leaders.

**The Steering Committee is committed to:**

- Improving and maintaining documentation for working groups, events, and major deliverables
- Establishing a regular cadence of virtual member all-hands calls throughout the year, featuring sessions led by [Ambassadors](https://todogroup.org/community/ambassadors/) and members
- Launching a lightweight mentorship program connecting new and experienced OSPO practitioners—building on research started in 2025

This builds directly on last year's work, recognizing contributors and improving processes. We want leadership in TODO to feel accessible and supported.

### G2 -- Help Strengthen Value Across Business Strategy, AI, and Security in their Organizations

OSPOs are increasingly asked to engage with AI strategy and software supply chain security—going beyond traditional open source policy. We're focused on supporting TODO members and working groups in creating guidance and reusable resources on these topics.

Key areas we're exploring include:

- How organizations adopt and contribute to open source AI as part of their broader AI strategy
- Use cases connecting OSPOs with security, legal, and platform teams
- How enterprise OSPO practices link to broader public-interest frameworks (e.g., UN Open Source Goals, academic research initiatives)

**The Steering Committee is committed to:**

- Participating in ask-me-anything sessions, birds of a feather discussions, and expert-led panels at LF and non-LF events
- Advising on [OSPOlogy](https://todogroup.org/ospology) and [OSPOCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/) program themes and formats
- Connecting with Ambassadors and Working Group Chairs to support their presentations at events
- Coordinating with sister ecosystems, Steering Committee members are involved, including [OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/), [Agentic AI Foundation](https://aaif.io/), [OpenChain](https://www.openchainproject.org/), [InnerSource Commons](https://innersourcecommons.org/), [CURIOSS](https://curioss.org/), [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/), [LF Europe](https://linuxfoundation.eu/), and [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/)

### G3 --- Keep TODO Group Community Resources Current and Easy to Navigate

Our GitHub repositories are the backbone of TODO's value proposition. Guides, case studies, and governance resources need to stay accurate and findable. This year, we're prioritizing maintenance work that sometimes gets overlooked.

**The Steering Committee is committed to:**

- Providing ongoing repo maintenance and cleanup for projects such as [OSPO Landscape](https://landscape.todogroup.org/), [guides](https://todogroup.org/resources/guides/), and governance resources
- Ensuring repos reflect current community decisions and align with open source management best practices and TODO Charter
